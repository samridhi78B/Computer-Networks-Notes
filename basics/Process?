#What is IPC?
Interprocess Communication means Communication between two or more processes within a system.
Example:
1.Browser asks OS for data
2.Music app sends audio data to speaker process

#Why IPC?

2.Processes need to coordinate

Note:IPC happens inside one system,
while Computer Networks happen between different systems

#What does PEER-TO-PEER (P2P) mean?
In Peer-to-Peer, all computers are equal and act as both client & server(It is a distributed system).
Example:

#Comparison:
P2P	- No central server, Peers share directly, Less secure	
Client Server - Central server exists,Client requests from server, More secure
