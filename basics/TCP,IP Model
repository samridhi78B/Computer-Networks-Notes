TCP/IP- The TCP/IP model is a layered networking framework that explains how data is communicated between devices over a network using standardized protocols to ensure reliable and efficient transmission.

#4-LAYER ARCHITECTURE
Application	Layer-(OSI 7, 6, 5)
Transport	Layer-(OSI 4)
Internet Layer-(OSI 3)
Network Access Layer-(OSI 2, 1)

# Why TCP/IP?
1.Practical
2.Used on Internet
3.Faster & simpler

# HOW DATA ACTUALLY FLOWS
->Sender side
Application → Transport → Network → Physical

->Receiver side
Physical → Network → Transport → Application

This is called Encapsulation & Decapsulation.
