OSI- Open Systems Interconnection Model is a set of rules that explains how different computer systems communicate over a network.

# 7-Layer Architecture:

Trick to remember: A P S T N D P (All People Seem To Need Data Processing)

7	Application Layer - Apps you use (Browser, Email)
6	Presentation Layer - Format, Encryption/Decryption
5	Session Layer - Starts & ends connection
4	Transport Layer - Reliable delivery (TCP/UDP)
3	Network Layer - Path & IP address
2	Data Link Layer - MAC address, frames
1	Physical Layer - Cables, signals

# Why OSI Model?
Networking is complex, so OSI breaks it into layers to make it:
1.Easier to understand
2.Easier to design
3.Easier to troubleshoot

Example:
When you send a WhatsApp message:
Layer 7: WhatsApp app
Layer 4: Makes sure message reaches
Layer 1: Converts to signals (Wi-Fi)
